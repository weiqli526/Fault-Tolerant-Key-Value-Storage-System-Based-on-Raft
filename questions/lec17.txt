In the Parameter Server architecture, worker machines do not talk to each other directly but only through the parameter servers. Why is this design choice beneficial for distributed machine learning?

Answer: 
This design choice simplifies the development of distributed machine learning applications and allows an optimization of the updates. In general, it provides the above 5 features: Efficient communication, Flexible consistency models, Elastic Scalability, Fault tolerance and Durability, and Ease of use.
