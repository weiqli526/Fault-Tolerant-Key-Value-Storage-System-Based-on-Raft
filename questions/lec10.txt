In Thor, after a server commits a transaction, the server sends out invalidation messages to clients that are caching data written by that transaction. It may take a while for those invalidations to arrive. Is it possible that other clients read stale cached data in the meantime? Explain why or why not.

ANSWER:
No, it is not possible that other clients read stale cached data in the meantime because the cordinator notifies the client of its decision after phase 1 and before phase 2.
