PAPER QUESTION:
Is it possible that a Raft-based replicated log is unavailable (i.e. unable to serve client requests) even if the majority of servers participating in the protocol are up and running? Explain why or why not.

Answer: Yes. If the leader at the current term crashes before the log is commited, the new leader may overwrite the replicated log.
